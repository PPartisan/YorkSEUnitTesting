# York Unit Testing Exercise

My submission for the unit testing exercise on the York MS in CS, Software Engineering module, exercise 5.3.4.

All commits on `main` will steps through the states of the code at various points in the exercise. There are also 
separate branches whose tips align with these commits. Run `git branch` to view them, and checkout any of those branches
to proceed. For example, after cloning:

```shell
$ git branch -a
1_define_interface
2_define_tests
3_add_york_implementation
4_resolve_failures
5_integrate_york_test_suite
* main
$ git checkout 4_resolve_failures
```
